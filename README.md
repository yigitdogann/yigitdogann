### Hi there 👋
My name is Yiğit and I'm a computer engineering student from Turkey. I will start my programming education september(2023).
I thought i can learn some HTML & CSS in my free times on this summer. I completed some courses. And nowadays, I do exercises, then upload them here.
Late edit: i started a JS journey.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript
