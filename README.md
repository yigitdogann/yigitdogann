### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is YiÄŸit and I'm a computer engineering student from Turkey. I will start my programming education this september(2023).
I thought i can learn some HTML & CSS in my free times on this summer. And yes, i finished my courses. Now, I do exercises, then upload them here.
Late edit: i started a JS journey.
