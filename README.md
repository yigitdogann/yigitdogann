### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is YiÄŸit and I'm a computer engineering student from Turkey. I'll start my programming education in September 2023.
I thought i can learn some HTML & CSS in my free times on this summer so I completed some courses. Nowadays, I do exercises & upload here.

Late edit: i started JavaScript (5 AUG 2023).

- ğŸŒ± Currently learning programming in C.
